## Siete Valles

The goal of [this application](https://github.com/jorgegorka/siete-valles) is to provide an easy way to integrate user engagement schemas and event tracking into your existent applications.

Tracking engagement both from users or employees has plenty of benefits. You can create specific schemas like an onboarding process and keep track of the progress of each individual employee. Or you can implement generic long term schemas and event tracking like tracking the activity of users on a website (articles, comments, likes, etc.).

## Use cases and examples

* Track important application events.
* Measure user's engagement.
* Lead users conducting important events like onboarding, placing an order...
* Etc.

There are a few [implementation examples](https://github.com/jorgegorka/siete-valles/wiki#examples) available.

## Technical details

[Gamification](https://github.com/jorgegorka/siete-valles) has been developed with Rails 6.1 and it has a Graphql A.P.I.
