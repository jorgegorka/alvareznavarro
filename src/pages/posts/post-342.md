If you work in Human Resources department of a company and have been involved in the process of hiring a candidate for a technical position you know that it's not an easy process.

Two types of web developers:

Academic vs. Business oriented

Focused on one specific language. Very good knowledge of the language. They don't need to check the documentation.

Business needs are not important. The code base is important.

For these kind of developers writing code is an academic process. They have a pattern for every problem. Code should be perfect and if it's not then it should be refactored.

They hate deadlines because they are an obstacle to achieve perfection. Duplicated code? Not in my repository. They can spend 20 minutes thinking about the right name for an object or a variable. Their code have 100% test coverage and they can spend the whole day refactoring a suite of tests mocking classes to decrease the time the suite takes to run by 7 seconds.

Technical debt is the worst thing that can happen to them.

They write tickets focusing on the "how".

They work for big companies. They don't like doing other things. They are the best at what they do and they do not want to do anything else. Another language, another framework? No thanks, mine is the best.

They hate the word "fullstack" they are either backend or frontend developers

Good enough is fine. They only refactor code to improve the user experience.
