I've been working on a [template to create web applications easily using Svelte and Firebase](https://svelte-firebase-template.web.app/).

You can [download the template](https://github.com/jorgegorka/svelte-firebase) and start using it right now. Just check [the instructions](https://github.com/jorgegorka/svelte-firebase/blob/master/README.md). It has all the tools you need to start developing web applications:

- User authentication
- Public section with a homepage
- Login page
- Signup page
- Admin section
- Teams management (CRUD).
- Employees management (CRUD).
- Reusable components (forms, modals, buttons...)

There is a [live version](https://svelte-firebase-template.web.app/) in case you want to see it in action.

## Goals

If you are interested in Svelte and Firebase with this template you can easily:

- Use Svelte to create a web application.
- Use Firebase Authentication.
- Secure Firebase databases with rules.
- Use Firebase function clouds.
- Create public and protected pages.
- Use it as the foundation of your projects to speed up development.

## Technology

This project uses all these amazing technologies.

### Firebase

It's a [suite of tools](https://firebase.google.com) from Google to help you create applications for the web and mobile. It gives you a database, hosting, authentication, analytics, etc.

### Svelte

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

### Materializecss

A modern responsive [front-end framework](https://materializecss.com/) based on Material Design.

Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology.

### Validate.js

[Validate.js](https://validatejs.org/) provides a declarative way of validating javascript objects.

### Svelte Router SPA

[Svelte Router SPA](https://github.com/jorgegorka/svelte-router) adds routing to your Svelte apps. It's specially designed for Single Page Applications (SPA).

## Summary

I hope this template can help people that wants to learn Svelte and/or Firebase to get some ideas and speepd up their learning process. If you spot any error or have an improvement [contributions](https://github.com/jorgegorka/svelte-firebase/pulls) are more than welcome.
