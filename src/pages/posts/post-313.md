[Peer-to-peer rewards](https://www.happymoodscore.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=p2p) are the best form of recognition at work. Well, maybe not the best but one of the best. It is in the top 3, that’s for sure.

In most companies recognition usually comes “from above” and that is good, we all love that our boss/manager recognise our hard work and commitment. That is part of your job as a boss because **to be a good leader you must acknowledge the work of your team members**. It is mandatory and if you don’t do that then you are not a good boss, period.

But when you receive recognition from one of your co-workers then things change, you feel proud and happy. Your self-esteem increases as do your sense of belonging to the team. And that is because your co-workers don’t need to reward you for your hard work. **They have no obligation, it is entirely optional and that is the main reason that it feels really great when they do.**

If you are a digital nomad or you work on a distributed team there is the risk of feeling disconnected. You work as an individual and your sense of belonging to a team can be very low. In these environments having a peer-to-peer reward system is very important.

The simple act of sending a virtual High 5 to one of your colleagues can have a big impact on both of you. It will increase your involvement with the team and will increase the self-esteem of the receiver. **It is the best way to recognise the work of those team members who are always ready to help, good team players, good co-workers…**

> Happy Mood Score has peer-to-peer rewards available for everybody, we call them High 5.

Don’t reward the rewards

A question that frequently arise when using Happy Mood Score Hi 5 is: _when I receive a High 5 from one of my co-workers, why I can’t see who gave it to me?_.

The reason is very simple. From my experience implementing reward systems on companies, people who receive a High 5 tend to give another High 5 to the person that sent it as a way of saying thank you.

That is not a good use of a peer-to-peer system and must be avoided. If you don’t know who send a High 5 to you, you can’t, obviously, give another in return. This measure will increase the efficiency of the system in the long term.

If you are a team manager, work for the human resources department or you are thinking about implementing a [peer-to-peer reward system](https://www.happymoodscore.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=p2p) at your company there is no better tool than [Happy Mood Score](https://www.happymoodscore.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=p2p).
