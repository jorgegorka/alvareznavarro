        My name is Jorge Alvarez. I am 46 years old and I've been working for the last 18 years in web projects.
        <br />
        Since 2005 I've been focused on SaaS applications: developing, managing, measuring and optimising.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004 I founded Oficina Inmobiliaria and in 2005 I launched the first SaaS application for the real estate market in Spain.
        <br />
        In 2008 the real estate bubble burst and the Spanish crisis hit me hard and I had to close the company in 2011.

        I'm the founder of Happy Mood Score a SaaS application that companies can use to increase employee engagement.
        <br />
        It has a proactive approach to get feedback from employees and a peer-to-peer recognition tool.
        <br />
        Happy Mood Score is also a metric that helps Human Resources departments or team managers to detect how engaged and happy are their employees. The application uses feedback, gamification, analytics and big data to increase employee engagement and talent retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your want to improve the feedback you get from your employees/team or your company has remote workers, digital nomads or distributed teams you should try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated on the first promotion of the Web Analytics Master directed by Gemma Muñoz and organized by KSchool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in Logroño (La Rioja - Spain) with Mayte and we have two children: Ariadna and Mario. We also have a cat named Pili.
