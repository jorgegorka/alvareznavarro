Netlify CMS is meant to be platform agnostic, so we’re always looking to expand the ecosystem and find new ways to use it. Check out our active PR in progress for Bitbucket backend support.



Git Gateway could also be modified to support other Git hosts. If you’re interested, you can file an issue (or a pull request!) in the git-gateway repo.
